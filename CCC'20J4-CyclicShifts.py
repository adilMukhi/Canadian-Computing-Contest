CCC '20 J4 - Cyclic Shifts Canadian Computing Competition: 2020 Stage 1, Junior #4

Thuc likes finding cyclic shifts of strings. A cyclic shift of a string is obtained by 
moving characters from the beginning of the string to the end of the string. We also 
consider a string to be a cyclic shift of itself. For example, the cyclic shifts of ABCDE are:
ABCDE, BCDEA CDEAB DEABC, and EABCD Given some text, T, and a string, S, determine if T contains
 a cyclic shift of S. 
 
Input Specification 
    The input will consist of exactly two lines containing
    only uppercase letters. The first line will be the text T, and the second line will be the 
    string S. Each line will contain at most 1000 characters. For 6 of the 15 available marks, 
    S will be exactly 3 characters in length. 
   
Output Specification 
    Output yes if the text, T, contains a cyclic shift of the string, S. Otherwise, output no
